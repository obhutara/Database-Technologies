# The lab report
The report should contain the following three files:
* A lab2.sql file with the code, same instructions as in lab1. 
* A jpg of the finished EER-diagram (with all extensions made in question 5 and all cardinalities)
* A jpg of the finished Relational Model (with all extensions made in question 5)

Place these three file into the gitlab folder.

## EER-diagram
Notice that this folder contains an XML file of the EER-diagram used as a starting point for this lab assignment. Download this file and upload it to [draw.io](https://www.draw.io).
Next, make your changes in draw.io and when you are finished, export the diagram as a JPG file which you add it to your lab report.

If downloading it doesn't work to the following: 
1. copy `https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/aleda145/database_technology/raw/7b18f55f9a847a60e2e216c05faf934bdcf1136b/lab2/lab2_ER.xml`
2. go to draw.io website, press create new diagram
3. click "From template URL"
4. Paste the URL
5. Name the file ER.xml and save it where you want
6. Done!


## Relational Model (RM) 
In addition to the XML file with the EER-diagram, this folder contains another XML file with an initial version of a diagram that represents the relational schema.
This diagram is not complete and you will have to fill in the remaining relations by yourselves. Use draw.io as before and export the final diagram as JPG file for your lab report.

## Lab2.sql
Like Lab 1: 

Question 3 should be answered as a comment in the file.
